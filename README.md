# HallowHouse

Project Pitch:<br>
Hallow House is a Halloween themed gaming app that allows users to earn treats, pull tricks, and rack up a score as they stash an ever growing amount of candy at home. This Halloween night won’t be all fun and games though, there might be a few negative Nancys that may give you no candy, haunted houses that will try to kill you, and you only have so much energy before you need to get home. Beware of the energy bar, if you let it reach zero... You will DIE!!<br>

User Stories:<br>
-As a user, I want to be able to click on a house and move to the porch<br>
-As a user, I want to be able to click on that front door, have the door be “opened”, hear a knock noise, and get X amount of candy added to my bucket<br>
-As a user, I want to be able to play a trick on these dastardly adults that don’t give me candy.<br>
-As a user I want to have an energy bar that depletes as I perform actions.<br>
-As a user, I want to be able to see my candy pile up in my bucket, and I want to be able to stash it before the bucket overflows<br>
-As a user, I want to be able to go to a new street and see more houses.<br><br>
